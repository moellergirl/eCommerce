eCOMMERCE WEB SITE
Introduction
Today we jump into the wonderful world of HTML and CSS. HTML allows us to mark up our web site content, giving it structure and meaning. We then take that content and position it, style it, and make it dynamic based on the device‚Äôs display by using CSS!
Regardless of the technologies you use to make web applications, HTML and CSS will always be used. Having some familiarity with core markup + styling concepts will put you in a good place, no matter the tech stack being used.
For this project, you will create a new web site that will serve as a home page for a business. By referencing a UX designer‚Äôs prototype and using the asset team‚Äôs images, you‚Äôll have a clear vision of what the finished product should look like.
Technologies
Adobe XD
HTML
CSS
Learning Objective
Create a professional web site that will introduce you to interacting with product designs while learning the basics of working with HTML and CSS.
üí° This is a SINGLE page web site. The only files you should have (aside from any images) are index.html and styles.css

Tasks
1.	Spend about half an hour going over the intricacies of the UX prototype to better understand various components and how they all interact
a.	Look over what styling has been applied, specifically what images, fonts, and colors are used (Is the font bold? What is the Hex color code for that item? Is there text overlaying a background image?)
2.	Write the HTML for the web site. Account for every element used in the prototype, ensuring good, semantic markup is used to define the meaning of your content in addition to proving structure (A <div> is helpful as a wrapper, especially when positioning a child element, but not every element should be one!).
a.	SEE SETUP STEPS BELOW FOR PROJECT SETUP
3.	Write the CSS for the web site. Focus on layout and positioning first (CSS Grid will help with this) before moving onto more specific styling. Remember, you should have, at minimum, 10 CSS rule sets in your stylesheet (rule = selector + declaration).
4.	Once you have completed the required user stories, move on to the bonus stories. 
a.	YOU WILL ONLY RECEIVE BONUS CREDIT FOR RESPONSIVENESS IF YOU UTILIZE MEDIA QUERIES IN YOUR STYLESHEET.
Setup Steps
1.	Create a repository on GitHub and clone it down as normal.
a.	Don‚Äôt forget the README.md as well as the .gitignore (You can select NODE for this project).
b.	Once you have navigated into your cloned repo locally, create your project files index.html and styles.css.
c.	Create a new folder inside the project called ‚Äúassets‚Äù to contain your Adobe XD prototype and product images.
2.	It is important to name your HTML document index.html so that it functions as an entry point for our web site, allowing us to create new pages later from this home page.
3.	Begin writing your markup in the HTML file. Account for all sections of the web site and each section‚Äôs content.
4.	Once you have written most of the HTML, move on to CSS to start positioning your content, starting from the top of the page and working your way down.
a.	NB: We recommend setting a few basic rules in your stylesheet to make your life easier. Write these 2 rules at the top of the file:
 

End Result
The final product will be a professional-looking web site that will have made you more comfortable converting your team‚Äôs designs into code using the front end technologies of HTML and CSS!

Other Resources 
We‚Äôve curated a set of links you will find useful in your HTML/CSS journey. There are many resources out there, so be sure to research carefully! AVOID using video tutorials that you don‚Äôt understand to accomplish your goals, as this will create potential problems down the road in your learning.
W3 Schools

Colors
When finding your color scheme, these resources are great tools. Coolers in particular is fantastic for flipping through colors until you find ones that look great together.

Semantic HTML
HTML, contrary to popular belief, has nothing to do with the styling of your content. For example, we don‚Äôt choose headers to make fonts bigger (that‚Äôs what CSS is for). We choose elements in HTML that tell the user what the content MEANS. Read below for more!
